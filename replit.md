# Aside - Personal Information Management System

### Overview
Aside is a robust SMS management platform designed to enable persistent message storage and seamless communication across multiple devices. Its core purpose is to intelligently organize messages and provide advanced integration capabilities. The platform includes a comprehensive set of features such as rich social media embeds, real-time shared boards, and an AI-powered hybrid categorization system. The business vision is to provide a user-friendly, SMS-first solution for saving and organizing information from anywhere, accessible via a web dashboard at textaside.app, with ambitions to expand AI-driven personalization and content understanding.

### User Preferences
- **Design**: #b95827 primary color (orange), #263d57 secondary (dark blue), #fff2ea background, Aside branding, mobile-responsive
- **Layout**: Logo in sidebar (far left), search bar and logout button positioned directly under shared boards section within scrollable area
- **Functionality**: No message input form - messages only via SMS webhooks
- **Storage**: Persistent PostgreSQL database for message retention
- **Integration**: Twilio for reliable SMS webhook handling

### System Architecture
The system employs a modern web architecture with a TypeScript React frontend (Vite) and a Node.js Express backend. Data persistence is managed by a PostgreSQL database utilizing Drizzle ORM with pgvector extension for semantic search. Real-time features are powered by WebSocket connections. The platform integrates with Twilio for SMS processing, supporting incoming messages via webhooks and outgoing notifications. A key architectural decision is the "SMS-first" onboarding flow and a content-aware conversational AI that analyzes saved messages for personalized responses. UI/UX design emphasizes a clean, mobile-optimized experience with a warm color scheme (#fff2ea background, #e3cac0 borders) and consistent branding using the Aside logo. Key features include multi-user authentication with phone number verification and secure magic link tokens (30-minute expiry, one-time use), user-scoped message storage, smart hashtag inheritance for message organization, comprehensive social media and general URL link previews (Instagram, Pinterest, X/Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, IMDB), shared board functionality with real-time notifications, and message editing/renaming. The system also includes an admin dashboard for authorized users with management capabilities, and a Squarespace integration API endpoint (/api/signup) that enables professional website signups with instant SMS welcome messages for seamless user acquisition. AI integration includes OpenAI text-embedding-3-small for vector embeddings and hybrid search (70% semantic + 30% keyword) available via both web and SMS, DeepSeek for hybrid categorization and daily affirmations, homescreen search bar as the primary web discovery interface with inline result display, and SMS search functionality that detects question patterns and returns top results via text message.

### Recent Changes
- **Fixed Pendo analytics visitor identification**: Removed all anonymous Pendo initialization logic. Pendo now only initializes after user authentication with phone number (E.164 format) as visitor ID. Changed createPendoOptions() to require user parameter and throw error if missing. Updated initialize() method to validate user presence and skip if not provided. All console logs now show actual user phone/ID instead of "anonymous". This ensures accurate user tracking and prevents polluted analytics data (October 2025)
- **Improved hybrid search recall**: Lowered relevance threshold from 0.25 to 0.15 to allow more results for conversational queries. Previous threshold was filtering out valid matches for queries like "I'm looking for asian gifts" not finding "Taiwanese Ceramic Red Stool". Lower threshold increases recall while maintaining relevance through hybrid scoring (70% semantic + 30% keyword) (October 2025)
- **Standardized Pendo data-pendo naming**: Implemented consistent generic naming patterns for all interactive elements: sidebar board links use "sidebar-board-link" with data-board-type metadata, dashboard cards use "dashboard-board-card" with metadata, content action buttons use generic names (content-delete-btn, content-edit-btn, content-external-link-btn), all 12 modal containers have specific data-pendo IDs (modal-edit-message, modal-delete-message, etc.), and all modal buttons use generic names (modal-cancel-btn, modal-save-btn, modal-delete-confirm-btn, modal-close-btn). This enables flexible analytics without code changes (October 2025)
- **Implemented SMS search functionality**: Extended hybrid search to work via text message. Users can now search their saved content by texting questions like "do I have anything from home depot?" or "find recipes". System detects question patterns (words like "find", "where", or messages ending with "?"), runs hybrid semantic search, and returns top 3 results formatted for SMS with titles, links, and hashtags. Includes comprehensive Pendo analytics tracking (query submitted, results returned). Works seamlessly with existing web search infrastructure (October 2025)
- **Implemented AI-powered hybrid search system (Phase 1)**: Replaced welcome message with search bar as homescreen hero. Users can now search saved content by meaning, not just keywords (e.g., "recipes for dinner" or "that article about AI"). Features: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small for vector embeddings (1536-dim), PostgreSQL pgvector extension, BM25 keyword (30%) + vector similarity (70%) hybrid scoring, real-time embedding generation on message save, batch processing for existing messages, inline search results display, relevance filtering (score > 0.15 now improved to 0.15 for better recall), comprehensive Pendo analytics (query submitted, results displayed). EmbeddingService handles async embedding generation without blocking SMS webhooks (October 2025)
- **Fixed hashtag 404 error**: Added missing `/tag/:tag` route in App.tsx to handle clickable hashtag links in message cards. Users can now click hashtags to view all messages with that tag (October 2025)
- **Fixed all link domain issues**: Both invite links and magic link (login) URLs now correctly use textaside.app domain instead of Replit workspace domain. Updated InviteService.getInviteUrl() and MagicLinkService.createMagicLink() to always use https://textaside.app (October 2025)
- **Implemented SMS invite system (Phase 1 MVP)**: Users can now invite friends to Aside via SMS. Text "invite" to receive a shareable link with unique invite code. Landing page at /join/{code} collects phone number and sends opt-in SMS. Reply "YES" to complete signup and track conversion. Features: automatic invite code generation, idempotent YES handler, phone validation, conversion tracking with referral fields in users table, 1-hour pending signup expiry. Database includes invites table tracking code, type (sms_link/web/qr), conversions, and referral tracking. Comprehensive Pendo analytics with 6 funnel events (Command Sent, Link Sent, Landing Viewed, Phone Submitted, Opt-In Sent, Conversion Completed) (October 2025)
- **Integrated Microlink.io for all link previews**: Replaced Pinterest-specific workarounds with unified Microlink.io API solution for all link previews. Microlink handles all platforms (Pinterest, X/Twitter, Reddit, e-commerce sites) with consistent, high-quality previews. Flow: cache check → Microlink API (primary, works without API key on free tier) → direct fetch fallback (OG tags/JSON-LD/oEmbed). Free tier: 250 requests/day, no signup required (October 2025)
- **Enhanced link preview support for e-commerce sites**: Added comprehensive JSON-LD structured data parsing to og-service.ts with fully recursive traversal. This enables rich previews for e-commerce product pages (Home Depot, etc.) that use JSON-LD instead of Open Graph meta tags. The parser handles deeply nested structures (@graph, mainEntity, ListItem.item) and supports multiple image field names (url, contentUrl, thumbnailUrl) with circular reference protection (October 2025)
- **Disabled shared board SMS notifications**: All SMS notifications for shared board additions have been disabled to prevent duplicate/unwanted alerts. Board members still receive real-time in-app notifications via WebSocket (October 2025)
- **Fixed duplicate notifications for rapid/split messages**: Implemented 10-second notification debouncing to prevent duplicate SMS when Twilio splits long messages into multiple webhooks. Messages from the same user to the same board are now batched and sent as one combined notification (October 2025)
- **Fixed board link 404 in notifications**: Corrected SMS notification URLs from `/board/{name}` to `/shared/{name}` to match actual routing (October 2025)
- **Fixed SMS notification duplication bug**: Added phone number normalization to E.164 format (`normalizePhoneNumber()` function) for deduplication logic to prevent duplicate SMS when phone numbers are stored in different formats (e.g., +15551234567, 15551234567, 555-123-4567). Both global cache and per-request tracking now use normalized phone numbers for consistent comparison (October 2025)
- **HTML entity decoding in Open Graph previews**: Added `decodeHtmlEntities()` function to properly display special characters (apostrophes, quotes, ampersands) in link preview titles, descriptions, and site names (October 2025)
- **SMS notification deduplication improvement**: Simplified cache key from `phoneNumber:boardId:messageHash` to `phoneNumber:messageHash` to prevent duplicate notifications when users are members of multiple boards (October 2025)
- **Added admin access**: Phone number 3182081034 now has full admin privileges alongside 6155848598
- **Domain migration to textaside.app**: Switched primary domain from contxt.life to textaside.app across all services (October 2025)
  - Updated Twilio webhook URL to use textaside.app
  - Updated README.md with new branding and domain references
  - All magic links, shared board invitations, and admin notifications now use textaside.app
- **Complete rebranding from Context to Aside**: Updated all branding, logos, colors (#b95827 primary, #263d57 secondary, #fff2ea background), domain (textaside.app), and UI text throughout the application
- **Implemented secure magic link authentication**: Replaced insecure phone-based auto-login with cryptographic token system featuring 30-minute expiry, one-time use enforcement, and rate limiting (5 tokens/hour per user)
- **Fixed hashtag cross-contamination bug**: Messages with different hashtags sent quickly (within 5 seconds) no longer incorrectly merge tags - preserves proper message organization
- **Fixed admin panel type imports**: Updated AdminPage.tsx to use proper OnboardingMessage types from shared schema instead of local interface definitions
- **Resolved onboarding message field mismatches**: Fixed OnboardingService to use correct database field names (isActive/content vs enabled/message)
